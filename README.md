## Hotel Reservation System

### üìå Project Description  
This is a Java-based **Hotel Reservation System** that enables users to register, log in, and manage room bookings through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Users can view available rooms, make reservations, cancel bookings, and manage their account details. The system emphasizes user-friendliness and robustness, featuring real-time database operations and supporting concurrent user access.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  

- **Swing (Java GUI Library)**  
  For building the graphical interface, including login/registration screens, booking panels, and dynamic tables  

- **SQLite (Embedded Database)**  
  Stores user, room, and booking data locally in a persistent `hotel.db` file  

- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**  
  Handles SQL-based interactions between the Java application and the SQLite database  

- **Concurrency Handling**  
  Room booking operations are synchronized to prevent race conditions and ensure accurate availability checks

- **Salt & Pepper Password Hashing**  
  User passwords are stored securely using a cryptographic hash combined with unique salts and a fixed pepper value. This adds an extra layer of protection against attacks and ensures that even if the database is compromised, raw passwords are not exposed.
